## Introduction

The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) is a non-profit gun control advocacy organization that is opposed to gun violence. The CSGV was founded in 1974, making it the nation‚Äôs oldest gun violence prevention organization. The CSGV believes that gun violence should be rare and abnormal. They pursue the goal of ending gun violence through policy development, advocacy, community engagement, and effective training. Through a combination of evidence-based policy development and aggressive lobbying, the CSGV is leading the way forward in fighting for a safer and stronger America. The organization has nine areas of focus regarding issues and campaigns. This case study will focus on two of them: 

1: Support for stricter mental health screening for firearm purchases. <br>
2: Ban the private sale of guns by instituting universal background checks.

Our analytics team has been asked to come up with strong, evidence-backed points that will assist the CSGV in gaining supporters.
